A simple tool to manage Semantic Version with shell

### Semantic Version
SemVer (abbreviation of Semantic Version) is a versioning scheme that is used by projects to communicate the changes included in a version release.
Semantic Version is the standard to define the version number.

The semver provides the following format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Each element is incremented by 1 when:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

For further details refer to the [official specification](https://semver.org/).
